*An entry from the journal of Bradbury Bennet, Esq., discovered at The Larches, Somerset.*

**11th June, 1852**

The evening air today was unusually mild, and heavy with the scent of honeysuckle. During my customary constitutional walk along the river, where the mist had begun to rise from the water like a silent vapour, this remarkable specimen settled upon the sleeve of my jacket. The Elephant Hawk-moth, *Deilephila elpenor*. The common name strikes me as somewhat overwrought, for there is nothing of the pachyderm about the creature - save, perhaps, for a certain quiet, massive elegance in its flight. The larva, I have read, is said to possess a trunk-like aspect, which is likely the origin of this rather fanciful appellation.

Its wings are a masterpiece of restraint - a muted olive green, trimmed and threaded with a shade of old rose that would not be out of place on the upholstery in Mrs Finch's drawing-room. I spent near two hours at my desk before I felt I had captured the precise geometry and the subtle gradations of colour. It is a creature made for the twilight; too delicate for the harshness of day, and too beautiful for the utter dark.

### Curator's Note
*This entry is particularly valuable as it combines Bennet's scientific observation with his considerable, if understated, artistic skill. The accompanying watercolour illustration (found on the facing page of the journal) is executed with the same precision as his written descriptions. The casual mention of Mrs. Finch's drawing-room is one of several such remarks scattered throughout the diaries, hinting at the depth and nature of their correspondence. It suggests that his intellectual life in Somerset was often framed by his ongoing mental dialogue with his London correspondent. - Dr. E. Reed*
