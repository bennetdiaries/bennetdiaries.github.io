*A transcription of a journal page from 1845. The original page shows significant water damage, which has partially obscured some of the text and the illustration.*

**12th July, 1845.**

A morning of fine, clear light upon the Mendip Hills. Observed *Cicindela campestris*, a creature of ferocious purpose. Its iridescent carapace shines like verdigris and copper. It pursues its prey with a directness Man reserves only for the acquisition of property or the ruin of his neighbour.

The Reverend Albright spoke yesterday for an hour on Divine Purpose. I find more evidence of it in this beetle's mandibles than in all of his sermons combined.

### Curator's Note
*This page is a poignant example of the condition in which many of the diaries were found. The significant water damage, likely sustained over decades of neglect within the wall cavity, presents a considerable challenge for our conservation team. What you see here is a high-resolution scan taken before the main restoration process began. The damage has unfortunately rendered Bennet's delicate watercolour work on the beetle almost entirely into a monochrome shadow of the original.*

*The text, however, remains largely legible and is classic Bennet: a precise scientific observation seamlessly transitioning into a sharp, cynical commentary on human nature and institutional religion. The Reverend Albright is a recurring figure in the diaries and the subject of many of Bennet's most pointed asides. - Dr. E. Reed*
