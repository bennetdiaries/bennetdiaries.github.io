# The Bennet Diaries Project

*An Archive of the Journals and Correspondence of Bradbury Bennet, Esq. (1797â€“1881)*

Welcome to the digital archive of the Bennet Diaries Project. This project aims to make accessible the newly discovered journals of Bradbury Bennet, a gentleman-naturalist from Somerset, whose precise and ironic observations provide a unique insight into the intellectual and social life of Victorian England.

The diaries, found in a forgotten deed box at The Larches estate in 2024, are currently being transcribed and annotated by Dr. Evelyn Reed of the Department of the History of Science, University of Bristol.
